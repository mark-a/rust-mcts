//! Implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm.
//!
//! This implementation follows closely the terminology introduced in [1]
//! and implements the basic algorithm described in section 3.
//! To use this module you need to implement two things: a `Game` trait and
//! a matching `GameAction` trait that describes possible actions in your `Game`.
